# Gtk4-PyGobject-Drag-and-Drop-Turotrial
A simple tutorial for Gtk4 drag and drop in python.

#
I have noticed that Gtk Drag and Drop tutorials are either complicated
or old (Gtk 3), which made it hard for me to learn it.
Finally, I decided to share it as simple as possible.
I am a beginner to Gtk, but for any question, I may answer.
