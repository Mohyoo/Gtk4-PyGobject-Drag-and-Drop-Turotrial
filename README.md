# Gtk4-PyGobject-Drag-and-Drop-Turotrial
A simple tutorial for Gtk4 drag and drop in python.

#
I have noticed that Gtk Drag and Drop tutorials are either complicated <br />
or old (Gtk 3), which made it hard for me to learn it. <br />
Finally, I decided to share it as simple as possible. <br />
I am a beginner to Gtk, but for any question, I may answer. <br />
